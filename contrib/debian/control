 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Rimecoin Core

 This package provides the daemon, rimecoind, and the CLI tool
 rimecoin-cli to interact with the daemon.

 tool which can be used without a rimecoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
